# Junior Mobile Developer Certification Test

What is up, everyone? My name is **Adi** from **Institut Teknologi Telkom Purwokerto**. Welcome to this page!

This is a mobile application developed as a part of the Junior Mobile Developer certification program. The app is designed to help with the population data collection process for the Indonesian Elections Commission named KPU (Komisi Pemilihan Umum). It allows users to record the data of residents, their location, and proof of visit.

The app is written with React Native Expo, a framework for Javascript programming language specifically made to develop mobile apps. Here are my reasons why I choose React Native over other frameworks or languages:

1. Lightweight.
2. Everything is cloud-based thanks to Expo.
3. Can be done in almost any computer.]
4. Crossplatform, meaning with just one codebase, I can develop apps for both iOS and Android.
5. Have I mentioned how lightweight it is?

## Features

* Record and store population data
* Collect location information with MapView and GPS markers
* Take pictures as proof of visit
* Utilizes Firestore Database and Firebase Cloud Storage

Once the app is installed, open it on your device and follow the on-screen instructions to begin collecting population data. You will be prompted to enter the resident's personal information, including their name and identification number (NIK), as well as their address and other relevant data.

Use the app to take pictures of the resident and their surroundings as proof of visit. Make sure to record the exact location of the resident's house, either manually or using the GPS feature in the app.
